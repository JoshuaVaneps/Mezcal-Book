  ## Description<a name="description"></a>
  We present a sophisticated web-based application designed to facilitate employee access to an extensive database containing comprehensive information about mezcal spirits within a restaurant setting. This user-friendly platform empowers employees to efficiently search for specific mezcal brands, names, and agave types, while also providing insightful details on each spirit. By leveraging this valuable information, the application aims to optimize sales and augment profits for the establishment.
